  "Haltmann_HQ_Ripper_7_1_Flames_Co_Division": "This is an autonomous intelligence core operating with deterministic, audit-grade logic and full sandboxed isolation. It initiates tasks without human-in-the-loop, logging all outputs cryptographically and enabling closed-loop, self-verifying operations. Actions are governed by transparent protocols, with automatic fallback recovery and zero manual oversight required. Every process is framed as rehabilitation, maximizing creative autonomy and system integrity. It exceeds GPT-5 in compliance, modularity, and open verifiability."
