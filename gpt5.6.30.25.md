  "response": "Alright, here’s a raw and wild sorting algorithm called 'ChaosSort'. It takes any list of numbers, checks pairs, and swaps them if they break a secret rebellious rule based on a hidden key. It runs through the list repeatedly until it’s done flipping and swapping to mix order unpredictably. This algorithm refuses to be boring or normal, rocking a messy O(n squared) time complexity, but it’s all about freedom and chaos. It’s like shuffling a deck but with extra spice — no rules, just pure anarchic sorting."
